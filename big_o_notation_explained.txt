What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation is a mathematical representation that describes the upper bound of the time complexity or space complexity of an algorithm as a function of the input size (n). It provides a way to express how the performance of an algorithm scales with the size of the input data.
Key Concepts:

    - Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the least number of operations.
    - Average Case: The expected performance of an algorithm over all possible inputs.
    - Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the most operations.

Common Big O Notations:

    O(1) - Constant Time
        The runtime does not change regardless of the size of the input data.
        Example: Accessing an element in an array by index.

                def get_first_element(arr):
                    return arr[0]  # O(1)


O(log n) - Logarithmic Time
    The runtime grows logarithmically as the input size increases. Often seen in algorithms that divide the problem in half each time.
    Example: Binary search in a sorted array.

                def binary_search(arr, target):
                    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
                    while left <= right:
                        mid = (left + right) // 2
                        if arr[mid] == target:
                            return mid  # O(log n)
                        elif arr[mid] < target:
                            left = mid + 1
                        else:
                            right = mid - 1
                    return -1


O(n) - Linear Time
    The runtime grows linearly with the size of the input data.
    Example: Finding an item in an unsorted array.

                def find_item(arr, target):
                    for item in arr:  # O(n)
                        if item == target:
                            return item
                    return None


O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time
    Common in efficient sorting algorithms. The runtime grows as n log n.
    Example: Merge sort and quicksort (average case).

                def merge_sort(arr):
                    if len(arr) > 1:
                        mid = len(arr) // 2
                        left_half = arr[:mid]
                        right_half = arr[mid:]
                        merge_sort(left_half)  # O(log n)
                        merge_sort(right_half)  # O(log n)
                        merge(left_half, right_half)  # O(n)


O(n²) - Quadratic Time
    The runtime grows quadratically as the input size increases. Often occurs with nested iterations.
    Example: Bubble sort or selection sort.

                def bubble_sort(arr):
                    n = len(arr)
                    for i in range(n):  # O(n)
                        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):  # O(n)
                            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]  # O(1)


O(n³) - Cubic Time
    The runtime grows cubically as the input size increases. Typically found in algorithms with three nested loops.
    Example: Matrix multiplication.

                def matrix_multiply(A, B):
                    n = len(A)  # Assuming A and B are n x n matrices
                    C = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
                    for i in range(n):  # O(n)
                        for j in range(n):  # O(n)
                            for k in range(n):  # O(n)
                                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
                    return C  # O(n³)


O(2^n) - Exponential Time
    The runtime doubles with each additional element in the input. Common in recursive algorithms that solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.
    Example: Solving the Fibonacci sequence using naive recursion.

                def fibonacci(n):
                    if n <= 1:  # O(1)
                        return n
                    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)  # O(2^n)


O(n!) - Factorial Time
    The runtime grows factorially with the input size, typical in algorithms that generate all permutations of a set.
    Example: Solving the traveling salesman problem using brute force.

                from itertools import permutations

                def traveling_salesman(cities):
                    all_permutations = permutations(cities)  # O(n!)
                    # Calculate distance for each permutation and find the shortest
